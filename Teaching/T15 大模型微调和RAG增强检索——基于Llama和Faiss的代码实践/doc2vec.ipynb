    "Here we are implementing this useful algorithm with a library we know and trust. With luck this will be more accessible than reading the papers but more in-depth than typical \"install gensim and just do what I say\" tutorials, and still easy to understand for anyone whose maths skills have atrophied to nothing (like me). This is all based on the great work by [Nejc Ilenic](https://github.com/inejc/paragraph-vectors) and reading the referenced papers and gensim's source.\n",
    "\n",
    "`doc2vec` descends from `word2vec`, the basic form of which is that it is a model trained to predict the missing word in a context. Given sentences like \"the cat ___ on the mat\" it should predict \"sat\", and in doing so learn a useful representation of words. We can then extract the internal weights and re-use them as \"word embeddings\", vectors giving each word a position in N-dimensional space that is hopefully close to similar words and an appropriate distance from related words. \n",
    "\n",
    "`doc2vec` or \"Paragraph vectors\" extends the `word2vec` idea by simply adding a document id to each context. This helps the network learn associations between contexts and produces vectors that position each paragraph (document) in space."
